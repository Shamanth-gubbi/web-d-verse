We are 4 college students with a shared vision to start a
global homemade food delivery service. Our journey
started at our PG where we all stayed together and
everyone used to face a common issue of food quality.
Nobody enjoyed their meals as they all missed the
homemade essence in their food. So One-day Kashish
and Saksham tried something new by cooking their own
food and shared it with their friends Parth and Tushar, all
of them enjoyed it very much and then a thought came
to their mind that a lot of students might be facing the
same problem, so they shared the food with everyone in
their pg and recieved great responses. Then they
expanded it and ended up getting orders from various
pgâ€™s and nearby localities as well and like this, they got a
really big database of consumers who want to have
good and healthy home-made meal.
